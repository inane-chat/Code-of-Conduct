*This policy is a "living" document, and subject to refinement and expansion in
the future.*

## Code of Conduct

### The **Inane Chat Slack** should be a safe place for everybody regardless of

- gender, gender identity or gender expression
- sexual orientation
- disability
- physical appearance (including but not limited to body size)
- race
- age
- religion

### As someone who is part of this Slack, you agree that:

* We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
* We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
* We respect people’s boundaries and identities.
* We refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically
  or otherwise), eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist,
  etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.
* We avoid using offensive topics as a form of humour.

### We actively work towards:

* Being a safe community
* Cultivating a network of support & encouragement for each other
* Encouraging responsible and varied forms of expression
* Shitposts

### We condemn:

* Stalking, doxxing, or publishing private information
* Threats of harm, harassment
* Anything that compromises people’s safety
* Personal attacks

**These things are NOT OK.**

### If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let’s:

* Listen without interruption.
* Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they
  have to say.
* Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offence in the future.
* Apologise and ask forgiveness.

Failing to follow the community guidelines as described in this document carries
consequences. For minor infractions, you may be temporarily suspended from the
Slack. Upon repeat offences, or if the community believes you are not acting in
good faith, you may be asked to leave permanently.

### Privacy

* All conversations are private unless otherwise specified.
* If you wish to share a conversation, or part of one, you must get permission
  from each person involved.

### Good conduct

The goal of the Inane Chat slack is to provide a shared space for inane-chat
alumni — past and present — to talk, share their experiences and generally keep
in touch. However, with this come some limitations and general guidelines as to
what constitutes good conduct:

* If you wish to air your grievances with, or complain about your current or
  former employer, that’s fine, but be mindful that your messages may be seen by
  people who join the workspace in the future.
* No Confidential or proprietary information related to your current/former
  employer should ever be posted on this Slack.
* Job adverts should be posted in #jobs only. Do not reach out to individuals for
  hiring purposes.

In general, treat the Slack as an extension of the official company Slack for
employees; consider anything you write publicly as having the potential to be
seen by any current member of staff, from anyone in HR all the way up to the
executive level.

**If you experience abuse, harassment, discrimination, or feel unsafe, let a
moderator know. Here is a list of the current admins and their Slack IDs:**

* Ben Darlow - `@kapowaz`
* Maria Neumayer - `@maria`
* Ben Pettifer - `@Ben`
* Amal Kakaiya - `@amal`
* Padraic - `@SpookyDog`
* Anne Byrne - `@anne`

*The role of the admins is to be an unbiased mediator, they will not moderate or
edit anything written in the Slack unless it is required as a result of a
discussed dispute.*

## Member Invites

The Inane Chat Slack is approved invitation-only. If you’d like to invite a
colleague, use the in-app invitation tools, and an admin will approve the
invitation for you.

Inane Chat Slack is a space to chat with friends and heartily shitpost. When
inviting people to the space, consider it similar to attending after-work drinks
at the pub. 'Can I bring my pal along?' Consider whether people will feel
uncomfortable discussing or letting off steam around them. With that godspeed
and good luck “netizens”!

If you invite a current or former manager then admins will announce it in the
main #inane-chat channel, inviting anyone with any objections to DM an admin. If
there _are_ any objections then unfortunately that person won’t be invited to
join. In the vast majority of cases though, there shouldn’t be a problem.

Because this Slack group is intended to be a positive, friendly community,
admins reserve the right to deny admission or revoke membership based on CoC
violating behavior outside of the Slack chat environment (e.g. in person,
GitHub, social media), if necessary.  If there is any person you would like to
keep _out_ of the Slack for any reason related to the above, message one of the
admins.

## Slack Etiquette

### Slack Commands

Many members of Inane Chat have this Slack open during the work day, or
installed on their phones. Additionally, there are members in many different
time zones. Please be cautious about using  `@channel` or `@everyone` and avoid
it if possible.
